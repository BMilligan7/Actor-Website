                    Brandon Dean Milligan is a young actor, and Washington, DC native whose soul is fed by the art. Brandon discovered his love for acting through doing YouTube videos with his friends as a kid, and ever since, entertainment had been something he was curious about. In his last year of college he acted in some short films created by fellow students and deeply enjoyed it, including <em>Governed Love</em>, which caused him to continue exploring drama.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After graduating with a bachelor's degree in kinesiology from North Carolina A&T State University, Brandon began seeking opportunities to enrich his craft by taking weekly drop in classes and seizing opportunities to act in professional television settings. In the beginning of 2025, he made the decision to go all in, and opened himself to studying at conservatories.
                </p>
                <p>
                    His first place of study was the Studio Acting Conservatory in Washington DC where he studied the principles of realism. He was soon directed to the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco, where he has been studying the craft from a holistic perspective, and immersing himself in the world of theater and performance. His studies have included work in Voice, Physical Theater, Acting Styles, Performance Making, and Alexander Technique.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Brandon creates performances that are inspired by his lived experience, creating characters with depth and introspectiveness. Through his art he aims to ask questions, create conversation, and influence the change he desires to see in the world.
